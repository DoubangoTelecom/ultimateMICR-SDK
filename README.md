This is state-of-the-art [Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition) dectector and recognizer using **deep learning**.

Unlike other solutions you can find on the web, you don't need to adjust the camera/image to define a Region Of Interest (ROI). 
We also don't try to use small ROI to decrease the processing time or false-positives. The whole image (**up to 4K supported**) is processed and every pixel is checked. 
No matter if the MICR lines are **small**, **far away**, **blurred**, **partially occluded**, **skewed** or **slanted**, our implementation can accurately detect and recognize every character.

The detector is agnostic and doesn't decode (recognize/OCR) the text to check it against some pre-defined rules (regular expressions) 
which means **we support all MICR types** regardless the font, content, shape or country. **Both [E-13B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#E-13B) and [CMC-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#CMC-7) formats are supported.**

Automating Bank account information extraction from [MICR (Magnetic ink character recognition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition) zones on bank scanned checks/document **above human-level accuracy** is a very challenging task. 
Our implementation reaches such level of accuracy using latest deep learning techniques. 
We outperform both [ABBYY](https://www.abbyy.com/ocr_sdk/) and [LEADTOOLS](https://demo.leadtools.com/JavaScript/BankCheckReader/) in terms of accuracy and speed (**almost #30 times faster**).

Using a single model we're able to accurately locate the [MICR (Magnetic ink character recognition)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition) zones, infer the type (**[E-13B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#E-13B)** or **[CMC-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#CMC-7)**) and recognize the fields: **one-shot deep model**. 
The performance gap between us and the other companies is more important for **[CMC-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#CMC-7)** format which is more challenging than **[E-13B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition#E-13B)**.

    ![Select sample](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/micr/docs/_images/android_studio_select_samples_videorecognizer.jpg "Select sample")

<a name="Sample-applications-Trying-the-samples-Raspberry-Pi-and-Others"></a>
### Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi and Others ###
For Raspberry Pi and other Linux systems you need to build the sample applications from source. More info at [samples/c++/README.md](samples/c++/README.md).



<a name="Getting-started"></a>
# Getting started # 
The SDK works on [many platforms](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/micr/docs/Architecture_overview.html#supportedoperatingsystems) and comes with support for many [programming languages](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/micr/docs/Architecture_overview.html#supportedprogramminglanguages). 

<a name="Getting-started-Adding-the-SDK-to-your-project"></a>
## Adding the SDK to your project ##
This Github repository contains [binaries](binaries) for **Android** and **Raspberry Pi**. The next sections explain how to add the SDK to an existing project.

<a name="Getting-started-Adding-the-SDK-to-your-project-Android"></a>
### Android ###
The SDK is distributed as an Android Studio module and you can add it as reference or you can also build it and add the AAR to your project. But, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by directly including the source.
In your **build.gradle** file add:
```python
android {

      # This is the block to add within "android { } " section
      sourceSets {
         main {
             jniLibs.srcDirs += ['path-to-your-ultimateMICR-SDK/binaries/android/jniLibs']
             java.srcDirs += ['path-to-your-ultimateMICR-SDK/java/android']
             assets.srcDirs += ['path-to-your-ultimateMICR-SDK/assets/models']
         }
      }
}
```

<a name="Getting-started-Adding-the-SDK-to-your-project-Raspberry-Pi-Windows-and-Others"></a>
### Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi and Others ###

The shared libraries are under [**ultimateMICR-SDK/binaries/<platform>**](binaries). The header file at [c++](c++). You can use any C++ compiler/linker.

<a name="Getting-started-Using-the-API"></a>
## Using the API ##

It's hard to be lost when you try to use the API as there are only 3 useful functions: init, process and deInit.

The C++ API is defined at https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/micr/docs/cpp-api.html.

<a name="Getting-started-Using-the-API-Android-Java"></a>
### Android (Java) ###

				    final Image image = reader.acquireLatestImage();
				    if (image == null) {
				        return;
				    }

				    // MICR recognition
				    final int exifOrientation = 1; // Normal (landscape) - no rotation
				    final Image.Plane[] planes = image.getPlanes();
				    final UltMicrSdkResult result = UltMicrSdkEngine.process(
				        ULTMICR_SDK_IMAGE_TYPE.ULTMICR_SDK_IMAGE_TYPE_YUV420P,

				        planes[1].getPixelStride(),
				        exifOrientation
				    );
				    assert result.isOK();

				    image.close();

				} catch (final Exception e) {
				   e.printStackTrace();
				}
		}
	};

	@Override
	public void onDestroy() {
		// DeInitialize the engine
		assert UltMicrSdkEngine.deInit().isOK();

		super.onDestroy();
	}
 ```

	// Initialize the engine (should be done once)
	ULTMICR_SDK_ASSERT((result = UltMicrSdkEngine::init(

	// Call this function for every video frame
	const void* imageData = nullptr;
	ULTMICR_SDK_ASSERT((result = UltMicrSdkEngine::process(
			ULTMICR_SDK_IMAGE_TYPE_RGB24,
			imageData,
			imageWidth,
			imageHeight
		)).isOK());

	// DeInit
	// Call this function before exiting the app to free the allocate resources
	// You must not call process() after calling this function
	ULTMICR_SDK_ASSERT((result = UltMicrSdkEngine::deInit()).isOK());
```
