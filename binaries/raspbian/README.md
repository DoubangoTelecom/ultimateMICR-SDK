These binaries were cross-compiled on Windows 8 using Toolchain at [http://sysprogs.com/getfile/566/raspberry-gcc8.3.0.exe](http://sysprogs.com/getfile/566/raspberry-gcc8.3.0.exe) for [Raspbian Buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian) but should work on both Raspberry Pi 3 and 4.

Please note that even if Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 has a 64-bit CPU Raspbian uses a 32-bit kernel and this is why we provide **armv7l** binaries instead of **arm64-a**.
